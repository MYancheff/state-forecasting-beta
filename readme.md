#### Description

Our project focuses on produces accurate forecasts of state legislative elections in Nevada. 

For the data science portion of our project, we are charged with importing, examining and cleaning, tidying into a manageable and malleable dataset, transforming the dataframe into that which are appropriate for our model, and create from this tidied data of every single legislative elections in Nevada from 1950 to 2016 (or the latest date on which our client Carl Klarner have information) a model of the percentage of a legislative chamber being captured by Democrats as a functions of other district, state and national factors we believe might effect how a eligible person vote. We will collect independent variables from national-level data (Gallup polls, president's approval rating for both election and mid-term year, and changes in real income per capita as a proxy for overall economic conditions) state-level data (our choice of state's legislative spending, legislative composition after election year, state-level income growth, elected governor's party affiliation, term limits and state midterm penalty) and district levels data (district level voting composition, incumbency and contestation data...).

Using these dependent and independent variables, we will produce forecasting models of legislative election outcomes. They will be tested for their goodness of fit and predictive capability. Our goal for the final end product should be to use the model to forecast for the upcoming elections in our state of choice, and co-write a piece with Carl about it that will hopefully get published.
